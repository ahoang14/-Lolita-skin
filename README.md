# -Lolita-skin


i formatted this w a lot of elements removed (post new, notifications, drafts etc) so theres two separate removal folders, one the extreme streamlined one and the other just the ugly things 
so if some of the formats wonky w the latter it is what it is 

uhh idk how much css u kno but gl trying to adjust it my codes a mess

make the main skin first and add the rest as parents
